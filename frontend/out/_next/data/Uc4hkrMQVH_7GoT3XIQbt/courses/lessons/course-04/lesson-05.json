Specific\n\nYour goal should be clear and specific, otherwise, you won’t be able to focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it. When drafting your goal, try to answer the five “W” questions:\n\n-   **What** do I want to accomplish?\n-   **Why** is this goal important?\n-   **Who** is involved?\n-   **Where** is it located?\n-   **Which** resources or limits are involved?\n\n### Example\n\nImagine that you are currently a marketing executive, and you’d like to become head of marketing. A specific goal could be, “I want to gain the skills and experience necessary to become head of marketing within my organization so that I can build my career and lead a successful team.”\n\n### 2. Measurable\n\nIt’s important to have measurable goals so that you can track your progress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you to stay focused, meet your deadlines, and feel the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goal.\n\nA measurable goal should address questions such as:\n\n-   How much?\n-   How many?\n-   How will I know when it is accomplished?\n\n### Example\n\nYou might measure your goal of acquiring the skills to become head of marketing by determining that you will have completed the necessary training courses and gained the relevant experience within five years’ time.\n\n### 3. Achievable\n\nYour goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. In other words, it should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable goal, you may be able to identify previously overlooked opportunities or resources that can bring you closer to it.\n\nAn achievable goal will usually answer questions such as:\n\n-   How can I accomplish this goal?\n-   How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints,such as financial factors?\n\n### Example\n\nYou might need to ask yourself whether developing the skills required to become head of marketing is realistic, based on your existing experience and qualifications. For example, do you have the time to complete the required training effectively? Are the necessary resources available to you? Can you afford to do it?\n","access":"paid","slug":"lesson-05","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-05"},"prevNextLesson":{"prev":{"title":"Lesson 04: Simple, attainable goals","slug":"lesson-04","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-04"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 06: Simple, attainable goals","slug":"lesson-06","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-06"}},"courseSlug":"course-04","coursePath":"/courses/course-04"},"layout":{"course":{"title":"CBSE Board(Class 8 to 10)-Maths and Science","slug":"course-04","curriculum":["chapter-02","chapter-03","chapter-05","chapter-06","chapter-07"],"published_at":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/courses/course-04"},"curriculum":[{"id":"chapter-02","title":"Basic software introduction ","description":"Learn about the basics apps like Excel , Powerpoint, Word","lessons":[{"title":"Lesson 04: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"35 Min","slug":"lesson-04","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-04"},{"title":"Lesson 05: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"55 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-05","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-05"}]},{"id":"chapter-03","title":"Learn to type fast like pro","description":"Learn to accelerate your typing speed","lessons":[{"title":"Lesson 06: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"55 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-06","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-06"},{"title":"Lesson 07: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"55 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-07","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-07"},{"title":"Lesson 08: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"55 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-08","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-08"}]},{"id":"chapter-05","title":"Interview Preparation","description":"Learn how to speak confidently in Hindi and english","lessons":[{"title":"Lesson 12: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"55 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-12","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-12"},{"title":"Lesson 13: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"22 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-13","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-13"},{"title":"Lesson 14: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"57 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-14","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-14"}]},{"id":"chapter-06","title":"How to speak clearly","description":"Learn to speak crystal clear","lessons":[{"title":"Lesson 15: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"46 Min","slug":"lesson-15","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-15"},{"title":"Lesson 16: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"46 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-16","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-16"},{"title":"Lesson 17: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"15 Min","slug":"lesson-17","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-17"}]},{"id":"chapter-07","title":"Personality development","description":"Learn necessary body language and discipline  ","lessons":[{"title":"Lesson 18: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"20 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-18","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-18"},{"title":"Lesson 19: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"35 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-19","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-19"},{"title":"Lesson 20: Simple, attainable goals","type":"lesson","access":"paid","duration":"40 Min","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed","slug":"lesson-20","path":"/courses/lessons/course-04/lesson-20"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
