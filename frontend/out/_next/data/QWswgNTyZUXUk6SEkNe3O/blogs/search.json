Curated by Sugarlift and Juxtapoz contributing editor and Colossal contributor Sasha Bogojev, the exhibition presents each artists’ understanding of themselves and of the history of self-portraiture. Cesar Piette’s abstract blue face resembles dripping paint partially masked by glasses, while Prudence Flint portrays a woman napping on a pink bed next to a guitar. Many of the artists created their first self-portraits in years, if not ever, specifically for the show, which includes work from Aleah Chapin, Cesar Piette, and Christian Rex van Minnen, among others.\n\nIn a conversation with Colossal, Bogojov answered a few questions about contemporary culture and self-awareness, how they influence self-portraiture, and the ways current conceptions of identity show up in ME.\n\n**Colossal:** How have perceptions of the self changed since the creation of such a selfie-obsessed culture?\n\n**Bogojev:** Oh, that is a tough one and I’m certain there are papers if not books written on that subject. But I do feel that a selfie-obsessed culture created more self-awareness on different levels. For this show, in particular, I feel like lots of artists wanted to fight against the popular idea of “self” or what we know now as selfie, by presenting themselves imperfect, flawed, caricatured, even grotesque in some cases.\n\n**Colossal:** So many conversations about identity center ideas of multiplicity, of people not having a singular self. How do you see that relating to the face and to self-portraits?\n\n**Bogojev:** Exactly! I think this is what most artists nowadays are fully aware of and that is why they struggle to find the “right way” to create self-portraits or they create multiple versions of it. Again, I feel it’s the superficiality of selfie-culture that made them extra wary of how they present themselves without jeopardizing their integrity and practice. With their artwork being the most direct and honest way of communicating with the world, it is not easy for an artist to pick one image, or even concept, as a single representation of oneself. I think this is why the artists in ME built their self-portraits by layering different visuals (Van Minnen), assembling a variety of elements (Shiqing), creating an atmosphere they connect to (Flint, Toscani, Chapin), captured an intimate moment that describes them best (Erheriene-Essi, O’Brien).\n\nME is on view from January 16 to 30 at High Line Nine in New York. If you’re in the city on January 21, stop by for “The Self-Portrait: Antiquity to #Selfie,” a talk by art and culture critic and author Carlo McCormick, historian and Sotheby’s VP of Old Masters Painting Calvine Harvey, and contemporary painter Jenny Morgan.\n","path":"/blogs/blog-06"},{"title":"How to Stay True to Your Personal Brand","image":{"src":"/images/blog/motivation-blog-04.jpg"},"category":{"title":"motivation","slug":"motivation","path":"/blogs/category/motivation"},"postedAt":"May 21, 2024","views":0,"content":"\nVisualize the logo of a brand you love. Now, think about three words you associate with that brand.\n\nWhen it comes to your business or career, you want people picturing specific things when they think of you. But in order to do that, you need to be intentional about establishing who you are and what it’s like to work with you. Think of this as your brand tattoo. It’s something timeless that never leaves you.\n\n### 1. Only accept projects that are on-brand.\n\nWhen a new opportunity presents itself, ask yourself: Is this on-brand for me? **Will this contribute to the impact I intend to make?**\n\nWhen you’re off-brand, you’ll feel like you’re chasing shiny objects because you’re out of alignment. When you’re on-brand, you’ll feel like you’re in flow because you’re making an authentic contribution toward your intended impact.\n\n### 2. Get inspiration from other leaders and influencers who are not in your industry.\n\nResist the temptation to focus only on your competitors—you’re likely to fall into the trap of imitating someone else. Instead, seek ideas from outside your industry. Don’t copy, but gain inspiration and strategy that you can uniquely translate into your own work.\n\nFor example, I’ve always been fascinated by how comedians brand themselves with a style of joke. I’m not a comedian, but I can apply that strategy to what I do.\n\n### 3. Remember: What got you here won’t get you there.\n\nYour brand should be timeless, but the way you translate it will change over time. Think about the brand you visualized at the beginning of this article. Have their product offerings changed? Has their messaging changed over time? Has their aesthetic changed?\n\nRemain open to being taken in a fresh direction while also staying true to your principles and area of impact.\n\nNow, visualize your own brand tattoo. What do you see?\n","path":"/blogs/blog-07"}]},"layout":{"headerShadow":true,"headerFluid":false,"footerMode":"light"}},"__N_SSG":true}
