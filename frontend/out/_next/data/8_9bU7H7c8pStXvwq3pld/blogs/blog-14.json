Over the long-term, relaxation can mitigate certain health issues, including hypertension, anxiety and even cancer (Esch, Fricchione & Stefano, 2003; Keefer & Blanchard, 2002), in addition to improving overall health and healing.\n\nHere are some mindful practices that you and your clients might want to try:\n\n-   _Mindful movement, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, walking or cycling:_ Your clients might be surprised to learn that one of the two common aspects of practices that elicit relaxation is repetition (Benson & Klipper, 1975), as is experienced during exercises like walking and cycling.\n\n-   Meditation: This can include any of a number of types of meditation, which you should encourage your clients to research. While some people thrive with an ongoing transcendental meditation practice, others may simply want a way to get 10 or 15 minutes of quiet time or prayer during a stressful period. This is where the second aspect of practices that elicit relaxation comes in—a passive disregard of thoughts as they arise (Benson & Klipper, 1975).\n\n-   Breathing exercises: Again, there are a number of breathing exercises that clients can explore, including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing.\n\n**Sleep**\n\nSleep disorders are common in modern society, with one in three U.S. adults reporting that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). This is only made worse by feelings of depression or anxiety.\n\nHealthy sleep patterns should be part of every behavior-change program and are particularly important during these troubling times, when everyone is under heightened levels of stress. Inadequate sleep has been linked to a variety of health risks, including heart disease, weight gain, depression and reduced cognitive function.\n\nShare the following tips with your clients to help them get a good night’s sleep (American Sleep Foundation, 2018):\n\n-   Create a relaxing sleep environment\n-   Follow a consistent sleep schedule\n-   Follow a soothing bedtime routine\n-   Limit exposure to bright light, especially blue light\n-   Try to be exposed to natural light early in the day\n-   Exercise daily\n-   Avoid caffeine and alcohol\n-   Avoid eating a large meal to close to bedtime\n\n**Social Connectedness**\n\nSo many of us are feeling isolated, lonely, anxious or depressed right now. As a health coach or exercise professional, one of the best things you can do is provide a positive experience each time you interact with a client. Also, remind them that none of us are in this alone, and that the importance of social connectedness cannot be overstated. Encourage them to use Facetime, Skype or another video conferencing tools to interact with friends and family members or to reach out to people they may have lost touch with over time.\n\nPeople all over the world are having virtual dance parties, taking classes online, attending virtual happy hours and finding other creative ways to have fun and take a break from the craziness we’re all living through. We may all be isolated in our homes at the moment, but we need each other more than ever. That’s great advice to share with clients—and to be mindful of yourself.\n\nSource: [acefitness.com](https://acefitness.com)\n","slug":"blog-14","excerpt":"\nWe could all use a little self-care right now.\n\nUnfortunately, many people’s usual coping strategies are simply unavailable at the moment, whether ...","path":"/blogs/blog-14"},"prevAndNextPost":{"prevPost":{"title":"15 RD-Approved Foods to Support a Healthy Immune System","image":{"src":"/images/blog/gym-coaching-blog-02.jpg"},"slug":"blog-13","postedAt":"Aug 26, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-13"},"nextPost":{"title":"Become a Better Blogger - Content Planning","image":{"src":"/images/blog/blog-01.jpg"},"slug":"blog-15","postedAt":"Jul 26, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-15"}},"recentPosts":[{"title":"Ten Benefits Of Rentals That May Change Your Perspective","postedAt":"Dec 02, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-01"},{"title":"10 Things Successful Mompreneurs Do Different","postedAt":"Nov 26, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-02"},{"title":"How Stay Calm from the First Time.","postedAt":"Nov 21, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-03"},{"title":"Brush Strokes Energize Trees in Paintings","postedAt":"Nov 16, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-04"},{"title":"Pocket-Sized Notebooks Hold Miniature Paintings","postedAt":"Oct 16, 2022","path":"/blogs/blog-05"}],"tags":[{"title":"finance","slug":"finance","path":"/blogs/tag/finance"},{"title":"artist","slug":"artist","path":"/blogs/tag/artist"},{"title":"motivation","slug":"motivation","path":"/blogs/tag/motivation"},{"title":"gym coaching","slug":"gym-coaching","path":"/blogs/tag/gym-coaching"},{"title":"general","slug":"general","path":"/blogs/tag/general"},{"title":"learning","slug":"learning","path":"/blogs/tag/learning"},{"title":"strategies","slug":"strategies","path":"/blogs/tag/strategies"},{"title":"methodology","slug":"methodology","path":"/blogs/tag/methodology"},{"title":"teaching","slug":"teaching","path":"/blogs/tag/teaching"},{"title":"online","slug":"online","path":"/blogs/tag/online"},{"title":"pinterest","slug":"pinterest","path":"/blogs/tag/pinterest"},{"title":"Health Coaching","slug":"health-coaching","path":"/blogs/tag/health-coaching"},{"title":"education","slug":"education","path":"/blogs/tag/education"}]},"layout":{"headerShadow":true,"headerFluid":false,"footerMode":"light"}},"__N_SSG":true}
