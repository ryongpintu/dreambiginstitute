The Brooklyn-based pattern designer and illustrator of Ohkii Studio documents the lush scenery, cavernous waters, and hilly villages she sees on the streets of Lagos, Calamosche Beach on Italy’s southern coast, and in Joshua Tree National Park. Mckay generally positions her miniature paintings against the real-life backdrop, juxtaposing the two depictions that she then shares on Instagram.\n\nThe artist tells Colossal that she frequently recreates some of the pieces in her sketchbooks on a larger scale after returning home, relying on her earlier representation for the tiny details she otherwise might not remember. “Often when I’m traveling, I have this urgent feeling that I need to capture everything I’m experiencing, the sights, feelings and textures of a place,” she says.\n\n\u003e I really enjoy that feeling of walking around a new place not knowing what I might discover around the corner. I often try to recreate the feeling of a place I have visited in my personal work… I really enjoy the experience of looking at a painting and being transported back to that experience. It’s a nice way to escape from your day to day!\n\nThe pocket-size notebooks are a crucial component of Mckay’s process, and she utilizes them in both her personal projects and her work for clients. “They just allow me to play with ideas and explore other directions without having to commit to anything,” she says. To pick up one of Mckay’s watercolor and gouache artworks or prints, head to her shop.

Curated by Sugarlift and Juxtapoz contributing editor and Colossal contributor Sasha Bogojev, the exhibition presents each artists’ understanding of themselves and of the history of self-portraiture. Cesar Piette’s abstract blue face resembles dripping paint partially masked by glasses, while Prudence Flint portrays a woman napping on a pink bed next to a guitar. Many of the artists created their first self-portraits in years, if not ever, specifically for the show, which includes work from Aleah Chapin, Cesar Piette, and Christian Rex van Minnen, among others.\n\nIn a conversation with Colossal, Bogojov answered a few questions about contemporary culture and self-awareness, how they influence self-portraiture, and the ways current conceptions of identity show up in ME.\n\n**Colossal:** How have perceptions of the self changed since the creation of such a selfie-obsessed culture?\n\n**Bogojev:** Oh, that is a tough one and I’m certain there are papers if not books written on that subject. But I do feel that a selfie-obsessed culture created more self-awareness on different levels. For this show, in particular, I feel like lots of artists wanted to fight against the popular idea of “self” or what we know now as selfie, by presenting themselves imperfect, flawed, caricatured, even grotesque in some cases.\n\n**Colossal:** So many conversations about identity center ideas of multiplicity, of people not having a singular self. How do you see that relating to the face and to self-portraits?\n\n**Bogojev:** Exactly! I think this is what most artists nowadays are fully aware of and that is why they struggle to find the “right way” to create self-portraits or they create multiple versions of it. Again, I feel it’s the superficiality of selfie-culture that made them extra wary of how they present themselves without jeopardizing their integrity and practice. With their artwork being the most direct and honest way of communicating with the world, it is not easy for an artist to pick one image, or even concept, as a single representation of oneself. I think this is why the artists in ME built their self-portraits by layering different visuals (Van Minnen), assembling a variety of elements (Shiqing), creating an atmosphere they connect to (Flint, Toscani, Chapin), captured an intimate moment that describes them best (Erheriene-Essi, O’Brien).\n\nME is on view from January 16 to 30 at High Line Nine in New York. If you’re in the city on January 21, stop by for “The Self-Portrait: Antiquity to #Selfie,” a talk by art and culture critic and author Carlo McCormick, historian and Sotheby’s VP of Old Masters Painting Calvine Harvey, and contemporary painter Jenny Morgan.\n\nSource: [thisiscolossal.com](https://thisiscolossal.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-06"},{"title":"How to Stay True to Your Personal Brand","image":{"src":"/images/blog/motivation-blog-04.jpg"},"category":{"title":"motivation","slug":"motivation","path":"/blogs/category/motivation"},"postedAt":"Oct 10, 2022","views":878,"content":"\nVisualize the logo of a brand you love. Now, think about three words you associate with that brand.\n\nWhen it comes to your business or career, you want people picturing specific things when they think of you. But in order to do that, you need to be intentional about establishing who you are and what it’s like to work with you. Think of this as your brand tattoo. It’s something timeless that never leaves you.\n\n### 1. Only accept projects that are on-brand.\n\nWhen a new opportunity presents itself, ask yourself: Is this on-brand for me? **Will this contribute to the impact I intend to make?**\n\nWhen you’re off-brand, you’ll feel like you’re chasing shiny objects because you’re out of alignment. When you’re on-brand, you’ll feel like you’re in flow because you’re making an authentic contribution toward your intended impact.\n\n### 2. Get inspiration from other leaders and influencers who are not in your industry.\n\nResist the temptation to focus only on your competitors—you’re likely to fall into the trap of imitating someone else. Instead, seek ideas from outside your industry. Don’t copy, but gain inspiration and strategy that you can uniquely translate into your own work.\n\nFor example, I’ve always been fascinated by how comedians brand themselves with a style of joke. I’m not a comedian, but I can apply that strategy to what I do.\n\n### 3. Remember: What got you here won’t get you there.\n\nYour brand should be timeless, but the way you translate it will change over time. Think about the brand you visualized at the beginning of this article. Have their product offerings changed? Has their messaging changed over time? Has their aesthetic changed?\n\nRemain open to being taken in a fresh direction while also staying true to your principles and area of impact.\n\nNow, visualize your own brand tattoo.

Set work hours that work for you.\n\nStructure is crucial. So is flexibility. When you’re first starting out, it’s tempting to test the boundaries of the flexible workday: wake up a little later; meet a friend for a long lunch in the park; opt for a post-lunch nap. These are all the wonderful things that become available when you work from home and have the ability to set your own schedule. For some, the opposite is true. Maybe you’re worried about becoming complacent. Maybe you’re excited about your new business and are glued to your computer late into the night.\n\nNone of these things are necessarily wrong, but it’s important not to slide to either extreme of the spectrum. You shouldn’t be working so much that you don’t have time for lunch with a friend or an afternoon nap, but you should also be cautious about a free-for-all schedule that lacks structure. A routine has many benefits. I’ve tried a variety of schedules, and this is the general outline of what works for me:\n\n-   Wake up early because my brain is more alert in the mornings, and that’s when my body naturally wakes me up.\n-   Knock out the hard-hitting creativity work first. This is the stuff that requires more of my focus and brainpower.\n-   Eat regular meals and use that time as a screen break.\n-   Add in a quick yoga session or outdoor walk—both if I can manage.\n-   Work the rest of the day in “pockets.” I’ll explain this further below.\n-   Set a cut-off time, after which I don’t check email or respond to notifications.\n\n### 2. Adjust as needed.\n\nI swing more Type A than B, so creating structure has never been my biggest challenge. I struggle with letting go, being flexible, going with the flow. My workday was once as early as you can until as late as you can. During that time, I learned that I truly enjoy early mornings. My body naturally wakes me up around 6 a.m. I also learned that about 3 p.m. is when my brain is absolutely done. But if I work from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. straight, I get eye strain headaches and I’m irritable. Not to mention I’ve missed some of the best parts of the day.\n\nAll this to say: Structure is important, but don’t structure your work-from-home life so much that you forget to listen to your body and adjust accordingly. I now schedule my day in pockets of time that best suit me. That includes taking a nap after lunch so I’m not sleepy the rest of the afternoon. It also includes working in short, productive bursts with meaningful and purposeful breaks in between. My way might sound ridiculous to you, and that’s fine. Start building your structure, but remember to check in with yourself and adjust it as needed.\n\n### 3. When tracking your finances, **don’t forget to live.**\n\nI love goal setting. I love making a big spreadsheet at the beginning of the year to track my goals. One of my big goals right now is to pay off my student loan debt within three years. I have it all mapped out, and it’s aggressive. With that goal comes savings and retirement account goals. Add that to my monthly bills and self-employment taxes means a big chunk of my cash flow is spoken for before it even reaches my account. I like to manage money that way because it makes me feel more in control of my future. But it can get to be too much. At one point, I was tracking every single daily expense to identify where I spend most. It didn’t leave any room for beautiful, unpredictable life to happen.\n\nMy financial tactics are from a mix of personal financial coaches I’ve read and written about. It’s sound advice. But I was forgetting a crucial element: Don’t forget to live. Track your spending, yes, but make sure to leave yourself some fun money—the funds that don’t need to be rationalized or judged. It could be as little as $20 per month depending on your financial situation. The bottom line is that you make room for the unstructured, the benign, the straight-up fun.\n\n### 4. Understand that money always comes with a cost.\n\nThe double-edged sword of working for yourself is that there is always another sale to be made. I’m a writer, so there are always more ideas to send and more publications to pitch. Being the spreadsheet person I am, I know how much an hour of my time is worth at this stage in my career. In other words, I know how much money I could make if I was working rather than taking a nap or playing beach volleyball with friends (one of my favorite hobbies).\n\nOne of the greatest lessons I learned is that money always comes at a price. In 2019, I hit a huge financial goal. It was my best revenue year yet. I was living in Hawaii and it felt like my every dream had come true. But I was also at one of my mental and emotional worsts during the summer—my favorite season. I often worked from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m.. Deadlines loomed large, and I often dreamt about my work. Every hobby and fun activity brought feelings of guilt because there was always more to do.\n\nI learned the hard way that every new client and every new gig means more money, but they also come with costs: the cost of my free time; the cost of my mental and emotional health; and the cost of my physical health at times. For me, hitting that financial goal wasn’t worth all the side effects. In 2020, I set a new goal: make enough to be comfortable, and then make time to do anything, or nothing. I’ve had to make some adjustments to my spending habits, but I’ve traveled more, laughed more and created more meaningful memories—to me, those things are priceless.\n\n### 5. Start new hobbies that don’t have any tangible value.\n\nI cannot stress this enough. I’ve been writing about and practicing some form of personal development for nearly five years. I believe in goal setting, accountability, structure, hustle, self-care, productivity hacks… the list goes on. I’ve also learned that it becomes easy to conflate personal development with some kind of tangible step forward. In other words, every action you take during the 1,440 minutes of the day must move you toward some goal—otherwise it’s useless. For me, it took some flirtation with burnout to realize that becoming the best version of yourself is also about doing things you enjoy, simply because you enjoy them.\n\nTake a break from your Jim Rohn collection to read some romance novels without feeling guilty. Write a short story without worrying about whether it’s good or marketable. In fact, don’t let anyone read it so you don’t feel external pressure. Build a birdhouse so you can look out the window and revel in the simple art of mastery without wondering whether it could turn into a profitable side hustle.\n\nThese hobbies round us out as people. They allow us to stretch some creative, competitive muscles while keeping the stakes at a nice, pressure-free zero. If you fail? Awesome. Try something else. If you’re terrible at the hobby but love it? Even better. Keep going and learn to laugh at all the feelings of I should be better at this.\n\nSource: [success.com](https://success.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-08"},{"title":"11 Super Useful Tips for Small-Business Owners","image":{"src":"/images/blog/motivation-blog-02.jpg"},"category":{"title":"motivation","slug":"motivation","path":"/blogs/category/motivation"},"postedAt":"Sep 21, 2022","views":981,"content":"\n### 1. Get clear on your life goals.\n\nAs small-business owners, it’s not uncommon to prioritize your business over all else. But, you’ve got to put yourself first if you want your business to succeed long term. Otherwise, you may burn out or wake up one day and realize you’ve built a company that is incompatible with the life you want. Get super clear on your one, five and 10-year life goals, then fit your business to those goals.\n\n—Brittany Hodak, keynote speaker\n\n\u003e Listen to the Hustle From Home podcast for more on organizing your priorities: Episode 103: Productivity in Your Season of Hustle\n\n### 2. Niche down first.\n\nBefore you try to target multiple products and various audiences, become an expert in one single offering. At the start of building a business, niche down to create the best product offering with the greatest value possible. From here, you can expand over time. This builds trust behind your brand and enables you more growth in the future.\n\n—Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc.\n\n### 3. Build your vision.\n\nEvery product, employee hire and marketing campaign needs to be rooted in the vision of your business. Build a deep sense of what this is and make sure to check that each decision you make is in alignment. It’s tempting to say “yes” to certain opportunities, but if they are not aligned with your long-term vision, you will lose valuable time and resources along the way.\n\n—Matthew Podolsky, Florida Law Advisers, P.A.\n\n### 4. Be patient with yourself.\n\nWhen I first started my business, I focused so much on growth that I neglected to focus on improvement. Details were overlooked, systems and processes were not a priority, and I wondered why I plateaued. Focus on the foundation, with steady improvement and dedication to your systems, and small businesses can improve.\n\n—Klyn Elsbury, MK Foundation\n\n### 5. Know when to delegate.\n\nUnderstand your weakness. Self-assessing allows you to see where you need support the fastest in your entrepreneurial endeavor. Thinking you can do everything better than everyone will get you into hot water. Understand how you can scale by making the right additions to your team and point them toward growth.\n\n—Brad Burns, Wayne Contracting\n\n### 6. Trust your teams.\n\nThere should be no room for ego in the way you manage. You hired people to help you do more and achieve more. Let them. Nothing is worse than a small-business owner who refuses to be proved wrong. Without embracing the fact that you’re not an expert in everything (even your own business!), you won’t achieve and get better. Trust your teams and the unique expertise they bring.\n\n—Thomas Smale, FE International\n\n### 7. Invest in content marketing.\n\nThere’s no substitute for having a great content marketing strategy in place. It’s essential to understand how to do SEO and use content marketing to rank well for a search term. This means multiple benefits such as free traffic, continuous growth and compounding return on the posts you create. You’ll establish authority and will spend less on other marketing activities.\n\n—Blair Williams, MemberPress\n\n### 8. Improve your social media marketing.\n\nAlways look for ways to improve your social media marketing. There’s always a new website or app popping up, and you never know which one will benefit your business the most. And the implementation of social media marketing is constantly evolving, as well. Be sure to keep up with industry trends so you’re always on the cutting edge.\n\n—Andrew Schrage, Money Crashers Personal Finance\n\n### 9. Repurpose your marketing assets.\n\nIncrease the ROI of your marketing assets by repurposing them. Transform each one into at least two or three different assets to save time and effort that you can devote to other things. A blog post can become several social media messages and vice versa. A brochure can turn into a blog post and infographic. Look for multiple ways you can use each asset and reach customers differently.\n\n—Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n### 10. Ask for feedback.\n\nWhen you first start a business, asking for feedback can be terrifying. Instead of worrying about what people might say, just ask. Talk to employees, friends and even connections on social media. Gathering feedback on your business early can help you make adjustments that change the course of your company.\n\n—Chris Christoff, MonsterInsights\n\n### 11. Don’t neglect the locals.\n\nIf your business has a market for local revenue, you should hone in on that. The locals in your community are more likely to invest in your business and become returning customers if they know you’re right around the corner and provide stunning service. Establishing yourself on Google My Business and local search guarantees more traffic to your business.\n\n—Jared Atchison, WPForms\n\nSource: [success.com](https://success.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-09"},{"title":"How to Give Yourself Grace to Start Again","image":{"src":"/images/blog/motivation-blog-01.jpg"},"category":{"title":"motivation","slug":"motivation","path":"/blogs/category/motivation"},"postedAt":"Sep 17, 2022","views":435,"content":"\nHere are some things I’ve learned for how to give yourself grace and start again to accomplish your goals. These tips apply in so many different situations in life, from fitness goals to business goals to raising children. Think about these any time you just can’t find that motivation to begin again once you’ve stumbled.\n\n### 1. Leave the past behind.\n\nFor some, it might be a motivational factor to be a little angry at yourself for failing. For others, that may have the opposite effect. Either way, it’s imperative that you don’t dwell on your mistakes. Think about what you want to accomplish today and work on steps to reach those goals.\n\n### 2. Take that first, small step.\n\nI knew that with several weeks of little physical activity under my belt, it would be unwise to jump into an intense workout program. So I started with one that takes only 25 minutes a day; it doesn’t make me so tired and sore that I can’t continue. And while it’s getting me back into shape, it’s also building a daily habit that will help me graduate to a more intense program in the future.\n\nThink about how this same principle applies to other facets of life. Want to read a book a week? Start by trying to read a book in a month. Or start with a shorter book. Want to eat healthier? Instead of eating only salads every meal for a week, eat one salad a day, or replace dessert with an apple. Do something small that gets the momentum going in the right direction.\n\n### 3. Find people who can help hold you accountable.\n\nHaving accountability is important all the time but especially when everyone is physically distant. It’s so easy to let yourself slip in areas of discipline when no one can see you. So it’s helpful to reach out to somebody close, share your struggles and your goals, and support each other in forming and sticking to new, good habits.\n\nI know I didn’t start working out again until I said something to my community group about how I wanted to do it. I’d been thinking about it for weeks, but it wasn’t until I had someone encouraging me, offering to join me, and making me feel like I wasn’t alone, that I committed to doing it.\n\n### 4. Take it one day at a time.\n\nIt only takes one day to start a new streak. You can’t work out 30 days in a row on a Monday. You can work out on that Monday and then again on Tuesday. But it can’t all happen at once. All it takes is a dedication to make today the day that you take a step in the right direction. It doesn’t matter what happened yesterday, and you can’t do anything about tomorrow yet; all you can do is make decisions for today.\n\nSo whatever it is that you want to start doing, don’t get lost in thoughts about how long it’s going to take or how difficult it might be, just think about what it will take to do it today.\n\nThese are weird times, and none of us know quite what we’re doing or how to do it. So forgive yourself for bad habits you may have started or mistakes you might’ve made in adjusting to your new normal, and look forward instead. A bright future begins with good decisions today.\n\nSource: [success.com](https://success.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-10"},{"title":"10 Essential Bodyweight Exercises","image":{"src":"/images/blog/gym-coaching-blog-04.jpg"},"category":{"title":"gym coaching","slug":"gym-coaching","path":"/blogs/category/gym-coaching"},"postedAt":"Sep 15, 2022","views":568,"content":"\nStarting a blog is easy.

Over the long-term, relaxation can mitigate certain health issues, including hypertension, anxiety and even cancer (Esch, Fricchione \u0026 Stefano, 2003; Keefer \u0026 Blanchard, 2002), in addition to improving overall health and healing.\n\nHere are some mindful practices that you and your clients might want to try:\n\n-   _Mindful movement, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, walking or cycling:_ Your clients might be surprised to learn that one of the two common aspects of practices that elicit relaxation is repetition (Benson \u0026 Klipper, 1975), as is experienced during exercises like walking and cycling.\n\n-   Meditation: This can include any of a number of types of meditation, which you should encourage your clients to research. While some people thrive with an ongoing transcendental meditation practice, others may simply want a way to get 10 or 15 minutes of quiet time or prayer during a stressful period. This is where the second aspect of practices that elicit relaxation comes in—a passive disregard of thoughts as they arise (Benson \u0026 Klipper, 1975).\n\n-   Breathing exercises: Again, there are a number of breathing exercises that clients can explore, including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing.\n\n**Sleep**\n\nSleep disorders are common in modern society, with one in three U.S. adults reporting that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). This is only made worse by feelings of depression or anxiety.\n\nHealthy sleep patterns should be part of every behavior-change program and are particularly important during these troubling times, when everyone is under heightened levels of stress. Inadequate sleep has been linked to a variety of health risks, including heart disease, weight gain, depression and reduced cognitive function.\n\nShare the following tips with your clients to help them get a good night’s sleep (American Sleep Foundation, 2018):\n\n-   Create a relaxing sleep environment\n-   Follow a consistent sleep schedule\n-   Follow a soothing bedtime routine\n-   Limit exposure to bright light, especially blue light\n-   Try to be exposed to natural light early in the day\n-   Exercise daily\n-   Avoid caffeine and alcohol\n-   Avoid eating a large meal to close to bedtime\n\n**Social Connectedness**\n\nSo many of us are feeling isolated, lonely, anxious or depressed right now. As a health coach or exercise professional, one of the best things you can do is provide a positive experience each time you interact with a client. Also, remind them that none of us are in this alone, and that the importance of social connectedness cannot be overstated. Encourage them to use Facetime, Skype or another video conferencing tools to interact with friends and family members or to reach out to people they may have lost touch with over time.\n\nPeople all over the world are having virtual dance parties, taking classes online, attending virtual happy hours and finding other creative ways to have fun and take a break from the craziness we’re all living through. We may all be isolated in our homes at the moment, but we need each other more than ever. That’s great advice to share with clients—and to be mindful of yourself.\n\nSource: [acefitness.com](https://acefitness.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-14"},{"title":"Become a Better Blogger - Content Planning","image":{"src":"/images/blog/blog-01.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Online Education","slug":"online-education","path":"/blogs/category/online-education"},"postedAt":"Jul 26, 2022","views":657,"content":"\nStarting a blog is easy.

Devote consistent blocs of time to the class\n\nOnline courses are often attractive to students because they offer flexibility, particularly for those with demanding professional or personal responsibilities. This flexibility, however, can lead students into trouble. It can be tempting for students to delay working through the course material, thinking they’ll find time later in the week.\n\n### 2. Communicate regularly with the professor\n\nOpening and using these lines of communication will benefit you both during and beyond the course. During the course, it’s important to ask questions when the material or assignments are unclear and discuss larger assignments such as research papers. Use the mode of communication preferred by the instructor (e.g. email, Skype, phone) but don’t shrink away from these conversations.\n\n### 3. Engage with your classmates\n\nDon’t limit your discussion postings to responding to the prompts posted by the instructor. Add your own insights and questions to the discussion. I always appreciate when students post a relevant news article or scholarly publication they’ve come across. These contributions help other students relate the course material to the real world and other areas of study.\n\n### 4. Begin your work early\n\nIn an online class, particularly for first-time students, there may be technical difficulties to overcome. Take the risk of these difficulties into account, and give yourself time to acclimate to new software and hardware. Further, give your instructors a reasonable amount of time to answer your questions. In an online class, exchanging emails or arranging phone conversations takes time. In short, expect that you will encounter hurdles when completing the work and leave yourself time to overcome them.\n\n### 5. Remember that online classes vary greatly\n\nJust as with on-the-ground classes, there are many ways to design an online class. Research course offerings ahead of time to determine if the instructor, structure and material are a good fit for you. Some online classes, for example, rely largely on the discussion boards to further your learning while others make heavier use of group projects, individually-written papers or collaborative problem sets.\n\nSource: [advanced.jhu.edu](https://advanced.jhu.edu)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-16"},{"title":"Insights on How to Improve Your Teaching","image":{"src":"/images/blog/blog-03.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Teaching Methodology","slug":"teaching-methodology","path":"/blogs/category/teaching-methodology"},"postedAt":"May 21, 2022","views":657,"content":"\nOnline learning environment can seem intimidating to students who haven’t tried it.

Effective learning management systems can empower departments and enable business growth, as well as further educational initiatives.\n\n\u003e Unlike the human researchers, the computer program was able to identify about twice as many systems. However, after additional investigation, the human researchers successfully confirmed about 97% of the info provided by Kimmon’s program.\n\nOver the years, LMS has become a vital tool to achieve enterprise learning objectives. It is no wonder the LMS market will be worth $22.4 billion by 2023. Learning management systems, for instance, can be used in several formats. You can use it as a formal, experimental, or social managerial compliance training program.\n\nMoreover, the role of eLearning to generate revenue for enterprises continues to evolve. LMS personalizes feedback to promote a self-regulating learning process. In fact, LMS has been proven to increase the effectiveness of students’ and employees’ learning outcomes.\n\n**The Evolving Role of the Learning Management System**\n\nA revolutionary change in the LMS is the contextualization of the learning process for teachers and employers. The right LMS can enable increased interaction between instructors and learners. Consequently, a collaborative virtual learning experience improves outcomes for online learners.\n\n**Adoption of LMS by K-12 Schools**\n\nIt is true – the skepticism towards LMS no longer exists. And why would it? The majority of institutions have successfully implemented the systems in higher education to improve student’s learning process. Similarly, LMS is now widely used by K-12 schools. It does, however, present an opportunity for researchers to learn the standardized testing process at such a scale.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the adoption of an LMS solution goes beyond higher standardized test scores. However, this effectiveness is interconnected with the cost and nature of the system itself. For example, an education system should have a proprietary system configuration, while an open-source solution is preferable for an organization.\n\nSource: [blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu](https://blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-18"},{"title":"Unveiling the Secrets of Online Teaching","image":{"src":"/images/blog/blog-02.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Teaching Methodology","slug":"teaching-methodology","path":"/blogs/category/teaching-methodology"},"postedAt":"Mar 13, 2022","views":786,"content":"\nOnline teaching is increasingly common at many types of higher education institutions, ranging from hybrid courses that offer a combination of in-person and online instruction, to fully online experiences and distance learning.

It’s understandable. There’s a certain comfort and familiarity we experience when going through the habitual motions of day-to-day life.\n\nThere are numerous examples of how individuals continuously engage in daily lifestyle behaviors without conscious thought because they’ve become habits. Driving to work using the same route without remembering the drive. Brushing your teeth without thinking because it’s just something you do. Or reaching for a quick snack out of convenience and a need for fuel without really contemplating the quality of that food. These are habits. Everyone has them. We naturally resist change because it’s challenging, but we’re capable of adapting to new behaviors when guided effectively.\n\nA health coach is somebody who can guide your behavior change. Here’s why and how a health coach can be a necessary and integral part of your healthy lifestyle team.\n\n## Health Coaches Use a Holistic Lens\n\nHealth coaches are trained in the psychology of behavior change as well as nutrition and physical activity. To encourage and elicit change for their clients, health coaches apply a multipronged approach that allows clients to dive deep into the root causes of current behaviors and the barriers associated with developing new behaviors. Health coaches don’t just focus on helping their clients become physically fit; they focus on all aspects of wellness.\n\n## Health Coaches Focus on Goal-driven Change\n\nHealth coaches also assist their clients in developing SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) goals. Clients generally come to health coaches and exercise professionals with a loosely defined, outcome-based goal (usually weight-centered) in mind. For example, “I want to lose weight” or “I want to tone up.” These goals aren’t specific, and they focus on the outcome versus a behavior-oriented process.\n\nSMART goals help clients clarify their intentions and identify barriers that prevent them from making sustainable lifestyle changes. Health coaches also assist their clients in developing strategies to manage the change process (how to practice portion control or plan for high-risk situations, for example). In short, a health coach is trained to guide you in developing a self-directed, personally meaningful and customized action plan.\n\n## Health Coaches Help Clients Enhance Self-reliance\n\nThrough their partnership with their clients, health coaches encourage the development of positive self-talk and self-reliance—both of which support long-term lifestyle change. Through cognitive coaching, clients also learn to alter their inner voices and ditch the negative self-talk and beliefs associated with making a change. This results in improved self-confidence and enhanced self-efficacy. The higher the self-efficacy, the more likely positive changes will occur and last.\n\n## Health Coaches Offer Nonjudgmental Support\n\nA health coach has a vested interest in the health and well-being of their clients. Health coaches’ interests lie in helping their clients see the bigger change and purpose for change (lowering disease risk, improving energy, increasing longevity, etc.). To do this effectively, health coaches put the power of change in the hands of their clients and inspire them to become the expert in their own lives. Health coaches do this by offering nonjudgmental support and constant encouragement.\n\n## Health Coaches Support Improved Life Balance\n\nHealth and wellness are so much more than physical activity and nutrition. It’s about nurturing a balance between the physical, emotional, social, occupational, intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. Because health coaches are trained to use a multifaceted approach to ignite change, clients are able to find and maintain a reasonable balance in their day-to-day lives. They learn to prioritize their needs in order to live healthier lives, whether that’s by improving sleep, reducing stress, practicing self-care, cultivating relationships or balancing nutrition and activity. Health coaches are the key to unlocking that potential for their clients.\n\nHealth coaches are unique members of the allied healthcare continuum. They apply their knowledge and skills in a way that motivates change rather than directs change. Health coaches actively partner with their clients and use skillful motivational conversation to help clients identify, develop and implement self-directed methods of change.\n\nBehavior change is anything but a simple and straightforward process, and it can be frustrating and bewildering at times. When it comes to changing behaviors, certified health coaches are central to helping their clients develop sustainable change and continue to manage those changes effectively so that they become a natural part of day-to-day life.\n\nWhy do you need a health coach? Because health coaches work to mentor, inspire and motivate. These efforts, along with the active partnership coaches create with their clients, ultimately lead to a more permanent state of change because clients have practiced and nurtured a specific set of skills and tools to support that change.\n\nSource: [acefitness.org](https://acefitness.org)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-21"},{"title":"Food Label Claims - Separating Fact from Fiction","image":{"src":"/images/blog/health-coaching-blog-03.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Health Coaching","slug":"health-coaching","path":"/blogs/category/health-coaching"},"postedAt":"Jan 03, 2022","views":235,"content":"\nStarting a blog is easy.

Many people use the terms interchangeably but they are not the same. However they are often linked together so it isn’t always easy to separate them.\n\n\u003e Game-based learning and gamification have been around for a number of years at the elementary and high school level. More recently it has been making its way into higher education as it offers a number of benefits to students.\n\n## What is Game-Based Learning?\n\nGame-Based Learning or GBL is using a game as part of the learning process. Some examples of GBL could be using monopoly to teach the basics of money management or playing scrabble to help improve vocabulary skills. However, today when people talk about game-based learning they are usually referring to digital game-based learning. Game-based learning teaches through repetition, failure and the accomplishment of goals which is basically the way players become good at video games.\n\n## What is Gamification?\n\nIn education gamification is the introduction of game-like elements into the learning environment to help motivate students and make the process more engaging. This is accomplished by taking some of the elements that make games fun and that motivate people to keep playing and using those elements in a learning situation. Some examples of gamification include:\n\n-   Points/Badges : The use of points and badges provides tangible evidence of accomplishment\n-   Immediate Feedback: Fast response to actions that are taken rather than waiting for a paper to be graded.\n-   Levels/Quests: Provide missions and goals to be accomplished\n-   Leveling Up: Indication of achievement and opening up of new missions, badges and activities\n-   Collaboration/Teamwork: Accomplish a goal working with others\n\nSource: [blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu](https://blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-25"},{"title":"Designing an Online Course from Expert’s Perspective","image":{"src":"/images/blog/stock-full-hd-13.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Online Education","slug":"online-education","path":"/blogs/category/online-education"},"postedAt":"Sep 18, 2021","views":732,"content":"\nTeaching in a fully online environment can be daunting even for seasoned online instructors when they have to prep a new course. However, with a few simple strategies, the process can be smooth and enjoyable. Here are four strategies that any instructor can use to successfully build an online course.\n\n\u003e Steps for success include involving the learner, making collaboration work, devising a consistent structure and revising based on evaluation. \u003cbr/\u003e By Amy Rottmann and Salena Rabidoux\n\nA common perception is that online courses require students to just read or view videos, and then regurgitate the information in an essay or simple discussion post. However, this is false because there are numerous activities that fully engage online students.\n\nStudents should demonstrate their understanding of the content as well as heighten their engagement with the content throughout any course. Instructors can incorporate authentic activities that connect real-world relevance and content knowledge. Authentic activities can range from examining case studies to creating problem-based scenarios in which the students research the problem and create solutions or address gaps within the problem.\n\nInstructors also can use inquiry-based learning (IBL), which requires students to investigate questions they have concerning the content. One strategy that online instructors can implement to establish IBL is through the implementation of Know, Want to Know, and Learned (KWL) charts. Utilizing KWL charts can initiate exploration of the content as students identify what they know and what they want to know about the topic.\n\nSource: [www.insidehighered.com](https://www.insidehighered.com)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-26"},{"title":"Why Online Courses Are the Future of Education","image":{"src":"/images/blog/stock-full-hd-11-1.jpg"},"category":{"title":"Online Education","slug":"online-education","path":"/blogs/category/online-education"},"postedAt":"Aug 13, 2021","views":123,"content":"\nHigh quality education can make all the difference in people’s lives. It helps individuals escape poverty, earn a promotion, or find better paid jobs. But getting a university degree or a training certificate often costs a lot of money, and strict class schedules clash with work shifts, preventing people from enrolling in educational programs.\n\n\u003e Fortunately, online courses are providing a viable alternative for millions of people. And as a part of the thriving e-learning industry that will grow to $325 billion by 2025, they’re no longer a fringe idea.\n\nInstead, online courses are becoming increasingly popular, and there are many reasons why they’re the future of education.\n\n1. Online learning offers convenience and flexibility\n2. High-quality student-tutor interactions\n3. Studying online is affordable for many people\n4. All age groups benefit from online learning\n5. More students can be enrolled\n6. There’s a vast amount of online learning resources\n7. Web-based learning will grow in popularity\n\n**Online learning offers convenience and flexibility**\n\nFlexibility is one of the key reasons behind the growing demand for web-based learning. According to survey results published by the university ranking website Best Colleges, 59% of students who enroll in online education programs have children and 50% of them are employed. They highly value the opportunity to study when they can, as lectures are typically archived for later reference, making compulsory campus attendance a thing of the past. Also, they can work faster or slower on course material, depending on their current needs and understanding of the subject matter.\n\n**High-quality student-tutor interactions**\n\nAnother advantage of online education is improved communication between students and tutors. A study by California State University in San Bernardinofound that although people who study online absorb knowledge equally well as those who go to class, they’re more active in discussions and enjoy a better interaction with instructors. Technologies such as video conferencing and VOIP calls make it easy to communicate with people across the world. Online students also benefit from more frequent assessments, with professors able to spot knowledge gaps faster and provide suggestions on how to move forward.\n\nSource: [blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu](https://blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu)\n","path":"/blogs/blog-27"}]},"layout":{"headerShadow":true,"headerFluid":false,"footerMode":"light"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blogs/search","query":{},"buildId":"p2TSSwkMOieCs2eTQJar4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
